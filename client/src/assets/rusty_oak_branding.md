Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the letter "A" in "ARMORY" on all sides.

### Brand Voice Characteristics

**Professional, Not Corporate**
We speak as experienced craftsmen and firearms experts, not as a faceless corporation. Our communication reflects years of hands-on experience and deep understanding of law enforcement needs.

**Knowledgeable, Not Condescending**
We share expertise freely and educate when appropriate, but never talk down to our audience. Law enforcement professionals are experts in their own right, and we respect that experience.

**Confident, Not Arrogant**
We stand behind our work with quiet confidence. Our quality speaks for itself without the need for excessive claims or hyperbole.
